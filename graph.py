# graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of finite set of vertices (nodes) and a set of edges that connect pairs of vertices.
# a graph can be represented as: G = (V, E)
# where V is the set fo vertices (nodes)
# E is the set of edges (connections betwn vertices)

# graphs can be used to model real world relationships (network, maps, social media)
# a graph does not have a single root
# nodes can have any number of connections
# cycles may or may not exist
