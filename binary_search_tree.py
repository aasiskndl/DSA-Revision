''' binary search tree is a special kind of binary tree where: 
1. left subtree contains nodes with value less than that of the root 
2. right subtree contains the nodes with values greater than the root 
3. if we divide them to individual trees i.e. left subtree and right subtree ten they are also binary trees individually
