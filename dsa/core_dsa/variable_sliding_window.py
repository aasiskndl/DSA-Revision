Docstring for dsa.core_dsa.variable_sliding_window
Variable sliding window is the problem used to find an optimal contigious subarray or substring by dynamically adjusting the window size 
based on specific constraints, rather than using a fixed size. 

left pointer -> at the start of window
right pointer -> end of window

TIme complexity: it optimized O(n^2) problem to O(n) by expanding the right pointer to include elements and shrinking the left pointer when conditions are violated
