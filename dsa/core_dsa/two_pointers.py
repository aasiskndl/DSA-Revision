Docstring for dsa.core_dsa.two_pointers
Two-pointers technique is a DSA pattern that uses two indices to traverse linear data structures (arrays, strings or linked lists)
simultaneously, often reducing O(n^2) complexity to O(n). 
It is primarily used for sorting/searching pairs, finding or reversing elements by moving pointers inward, outward or in the same direction.

Working: Instead of nested loops, two pointers move from start and end or both from start, adjusting based on conditions.
