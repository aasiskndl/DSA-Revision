Docstring for dsa.backtracking.permutations
Backtracking for permutation is a systemaic, recursive algorithm that generates all possible ordering of a set of element by building candidates incrementally.
It explores potential sequences, and upon reaching a full permutaion or invalid state,
it undoes the last choicee (backtracks) to try alternative options, creating a tree of possibilities.

goal is to generate all possible ordered arrangements (permutation) of a given set of distinct elements.
